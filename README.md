# Experimental ARPAsing Recording Scripts
Sometime in 2018, Kanru Hua released PDF files for two additional experimental ARPAsing reclists. I updated the 0.1.0 and 0.2.0 reclists to have 5 digit numbers in order to be compatible, but never got around to transcribing these lists. Volunteers are welcome to make pull requests with txt file trancriptions.

Experimental recording script (No. 10000 - 10199)

**What is this?** - this document is an experimental Arpasing recording script consisting of 200 phrases selected from public-domain books collected by the Project Gutenberg.

**Does it perform better than the original 220-line script?** - the performance largely depends on the quality of the recorded voice, which in turns (partially) depends on the ease of pronunciation. The purpose of designing this phrase-based script is to reduce recording efforts. Whether or not it will work yet has to be tested.

**Do I have to read through the whole script?** - no. The first 65 lines are expected to make it sound as good as the original 220-line script (No. 00000 - 00219). It is also expected that the more you record, the better it will sound, if the recording quality doesn’t degrade towards the end due to human fatigue.
